# Churn---forcast-and-prediction
The gym chain Model Fitness is developing a customer interaction strategy based on analytical data. One of the most common problems gyms and other services face is customer churn. How do you know if a customer is no longer with you? You can calculate churn based on people who get rid of their accounts or don't renew their contracts. However, sometimes it's not obvious that a client has left: they may walk out on tiptoes.  In order to fight churn, Model Fitness has digitized a number of its customer profiles. Your task is to analyze them and come up with a customer retention strategy. You should: Learn to predict the probability of churn (for the upcoming month) for each customer Draw up typical user portraits: select the most outstanding groups and describe their main features Analyze the factors that impact churn most Draw basic conclusions and develop recommendations on how to improve customer service: Identify target groups Suggest measures to cut churn Describe any other patterns you see with respect to interaction with customers
